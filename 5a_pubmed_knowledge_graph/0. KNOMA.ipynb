    "## What is knowledge graph (KG)?\n",
    "\n",
    "A knowledge graph (KG) represents a network of entities and the relationship among them. Entities are objects, events, situations, and/or concepts. They are represented as nodes in KG. The relationship between two entities is expressed as an edge. In KG, the edge is described as a predicate connecting a source node (subject) and a destination node (object). The network of subject-predicate-object relationships between thousands of entities constitutes knowledge, therefore it is a knowledge graph."

Entities are extracted from documents in pdf format and KG is built based on the extracted entities and relationships among them. \n",
